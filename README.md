# Capstone-Project
An exploration of worldwide electricity consumption 

## Overview
In this final project, students were tasked with finding their own dataset, performing multilinear regression analysis to find insights and conclusions. This project looks at data on **world electricity generation**, with the aim of providing an insight into some of the factors that affect electricity generation per capita. 

A non technical presentation of the findings can be found under **Capstone Project Presentation.pdf**. 

Details of my working, with all python code, and three iterations of the model, can be found under **World_Electricity_Consumption_Notebook.ipynb**.

## The Dataset
The World Energy Consumption dataset was
published on kaggle by Pralabh Poudel, and is a
collection of key metrics maintained by *Our
World in Data*.

This dataset has energy data for every country,
with 129 variables and over 22,000 rows.

Our final cleaned dataset had around 2500 rows. And
focused on:
- **net electric imports**
- **GDP per capita**
- **coal production**
- **oil production**
- **greenhouse gas emissions per capita**
- **year**
- percentage share of total energy by type:
**biofuel, coal gas, hydro, oil, nuclear, solar, wind**
