# Capstone-Project
An exploration of worldwide electricity consumption 

## Overview
In this final project, students are tasked with finding their own dataset, performing multilinear regression analysis to find insights and conclusions. This project looks at data on **world electricity generation**, with the aim of providing an insight into some of the factors that affect electricity generation per capita.  

## The Dataset
The World Energy Consumption dataset was
published on kaggle by Pralabh Poudel, and is a
collection of key metrics maintained by *Our
World in Data*.

This dataset has energy data for every country,
with 129 variables and over 22,000 rows.

Before diving into the data, we decided to focus
on data f rom 2001 onwards. Unfortunately there
was too much missing data between 2019 - 2022,
so our data focuses on 2001 - 2018.

Countries with populations smaller than 2
million were excluded to emphasize trends
within larger population groups.

Our final cleaned dataset had around 2500 rows. And
focused on:
- **net electric imports**
- **GDP per capita**
- **coal production**
- **oil production**
- **greenhouse gas emissions per capita**
- **year**
- percentage share of total energy by type:
**biofuel, coal gas, hydro, oil, nuclear, solar, wind**
